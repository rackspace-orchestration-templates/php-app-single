  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to PHP, the [Getting
  Started](http://www.php.net/manual/en/getting-started.php) page can walk you
  through the basics of PHP and it's uses.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Deploying Your Code
  If your deployment has multiple application servers, deployment tools such as
  Capistrano, Phing, or even git can simplify the deployment process. It's best
  to evaluate all options independently to determine which tool works best for
  your use case. There are other methods for deployment including using
  configuration and infrastructure management tools like
  [Chef](http://docs.opscode.com/resource_deploy.html#deploy-strategies).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using
  [chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html). Once the deployment is
  up, chef will not run again, so it is safe to modify configurations.

  [PHP](http://www.php.net/) was installed using the packaged version for your
  operating system. Newer versions of PHP will be available with newer versions
  of the operating system. We recommend using the packaged version as opposed
  to a source based installation for easier long term managmement, patching,
  and supportability.

  All web content will be served by [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/).  The
  configuration can be found in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled. The name of the
  configuration file will be the same as the name of the site provided as a
  part of this deployment. Any changes made to this configuration will require
  a restart of Apache. By default, the Document Root for your site will be
  /var/www/vhosts/application/.

  [Memcached](http://memcached.org/) is installed to handle object caching. By
  default, Memcached is configured to listen on localhost, port 11211.
  Memcached is most commonly used to cache object information so that they can
  be called from memory as opposed to querying a backend database. The
  configuration can be found in /etc/memcached.conf. Any changes made to the
  configuration file will require a the memcached service to be restarted.

  [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) has been installed on a Cloud Database
  instance.

  #### Adding PHP Modules or Extensions
  There are several options for adding support to PHP. We recommend leveraging
  as many packaged modules as possible. Use the system package manager to
  search for an install modules. Here's an example of how to search for
  availalbe modules of PHP 5 on Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  root@app01:~# apt-cache search php5-
  php5-cgi - server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (CGI binary)
  php5-cli - command-line interpreter for the php5 scripting language
  php5-common - Common files for packages built from the php5 source
  php5-curl - CURL module for php5
  php5-dbg - Debug symbols for PHP5
  php5-dev - Files for PHP5 module development
  php5-gd - GD module for php5
  php5-gmp - GMP module for php5
  php5-ldap - LDAP module for php5
  php5-mysql - MySQL module for php5
  ...
  ```
  Once you find the appropriate package, the package manager can be used to
  handle the installation. Here's an example on how we would install the
  php5-gd package on Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  apt-get install -y php5-gd
  ```
  If you're looking to install something that is not found in the default
  repositories, you can use [PECL](http://pecl.php.net/),
  [PEAR](http://pear.php.net/), or
  [phpize](http://php.net/manual/en/install.pecl.phpize.php) to complete the
  installation. Follow any instructions provided with the application you are
  installing for more detail on how to best install the necessary modules or
  extensions.

  #### Updating PHP
  Since the PHP installation was done using the package manager for the
  operating system, the update can also be performed by the package manager. If
  you're looking for a different major or minor version of PHP, you may want to
  consider running a different version of the operating system. Most operating
  systems lock in specific major, minor, and release versions, and they only
  release updates for bugs or security fixes.
